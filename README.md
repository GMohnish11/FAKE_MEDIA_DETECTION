FAKE_MEDIA_DETECTION
Overview
This repository, FAKE_MEDIA_DETECTION, is dedicated to detecting fake media, including deepfake videos, manipulated images, and synthesized audio. Developed by [GMohnish11], it uses advanced machine learning techniques to identify synthetic or altered content, helping to combat misinformation. The project includes scripts for preprocessing, training, and evaluating models, along with support for popular datasets.
Features

Deepfake video detection using CNN and RNN architectures.
Image manipulation detection with pre-trained models.
Audio deepfake detection via spectral analysis.
Support for datasets like DFDC, FaceForensics++, and FakeAVCeleb.
Modular codebase for easy extension and integration.

Installation

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/GMohnish11/FAKE_MEDIA_DETECTION.git
cd FAKE_MEDIA_DETECTION


Install dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt


(Optional) Configure GPU support:
Ensure CUDA and cuDNN are installed for PyTorch or TensorFlow.


Download pre-trained models:./scripts/download_models.sh



Usage
Inference
To detect fake media:
python src/inference.py --model deepfake_detector --input path/to/media/sample.mp4

Output: Probability of the media being fake.
Training
To train a model:
python src/train.py --dataset path/to/dataset --model deepfake_detector --epochs 30

Edit config.yaml for hyperparameters.
Evaluation
To evaluate a model:
python src/evaluate.py --model path/to/saved_model --dataset path/to/test_dataset

Metrics: Accuracy, F1-score, AUC.
Datasets
Supported datasets:

DeepFake Detection Challenge (DFDC): Video deepfakes.
FaceForensics++: Manipulated videos and images.
FakeAVCeleb: Audio-video deepfakes.Place datasets in data/ and preprocess using:

python scripts/preprocess.py --dataset dfdc
